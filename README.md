### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Michal Němec, and you'll learn a bit about my work in this file.



## 🏎️ Try out

Two projects I've worked on are available to you (a Mac user) via Homebrew.

### 🪩 Diskostat

The best utility to make some space. Built with Rust and a few colleagues from my university. I've created the backbone of this project: the data structure and algorithm to compute the folder sizes. The computation is done in parallel with proper synchronization and memory handling.

- [Project's repo](https://github.com/Diskostat/diskostat/tree/feature/update-readme).
- Install: `brew tap Diskostat/homebrew-diskostat && brew install diskostat`.
- Use: `disko` and `disko --help` for cli settings.

### 🌌 SpaceAlias

Never forget which macOS space are you on by making aliases for your spaces in the menu bar!

- [Project's repo](https://gitlab.com/BajaCali/spacealias)
- Installation and usasge in the repo ☝️.
