### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Michal Němec, and you'll learn a bit about my work in this file.

## 🏎️ Try out

Two projects I've worked on are available to you (a Mac user) via Homebrew.

### 🪩 Diskostat

[Project's repo](https://github.com/Diskostat/diskostat/tree/feature/update-readme). The best utility to make some space. Built with Rust and a few colleagues from my university. I've created the backbone of this project: the data structure and algorithm to compute the folder sizes. The computation is done in parallel with proper synchronization and memory handling.

- Install: `brew tap Diskostat/homebrew-diskostat && brew install diskostat`.
- Use: `disko` and `disko --help` for cli settings.

### 🌌 SpaceAlias

[Project's repo](https://gitlab.com/BajaCali/spacealias). Never forget which macOS space you are on by making aliases for your spaces in the menu bar!

- Installation and usage in the repo ☝️.


## 📱 iOS Showcase

While professional projects have been my primary focus, I am eager to share one small personal project with you. 

### MoneyWellSpend

[Project's repo](https://gitlab.com/apodidae/money-well-spend). Organize your money across accounts and assign them a purpose.


## 🛠️ iOS Development tools

I am also passionate about the process of crafting apps. Therefore, I forked and contributed to several projects regarding the process.


### 💉 Dependency Injection

[My fork's repo](https://gitlab.com/apodidae/ios-dependency-injection). Container Dependency Injection framework was originally from [STRV](https://github.com/strvcom/ios-dependency-injection).

- Created [Swift property wrapper](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Property-Wrappers) to integrate nicely with SwiftUI.

### 📒 FTLogKit

[Project's repo](https://github.com/BajaCali/FTLogKit). I've created a logging framework with the ambition to unify logging across projects at a company I worked for.

- Several customizations
- Synchronization with [Swift Actor](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/actor)

### 🏄 License2Chill

[Project's repo](https://gitlab.com/apodidae/license2chill). Framework for testing in the philosophy of Behaviour-driven Development.
